# I see '401 - Bad Credentials.' in the terminal. What does this mean, and how can I fix it?

This means your Github Token has been expired. Your Github account need to be reauthorized with Commit.Live account. Contact tech@greyatom.com to know how to fix this.

# I see 'No passwd entry for user "undefined/username"' and cannot work in the IDE, how can I fix this?

This means one of two things:

1. Your account was not created on the IDE server

or

2. You changed your GitHub username between when your account was created on the IDE server and when you tried to connect.

Then ask for help from the Commit.live at tech@greyatom.com
