This means your Github Token has been expired. Your Github account need to be reauthorized with Commit.Live account. Contact tech@greyatom.com to know how to fix this.

# I see 'No passwd entry for user "undefined/username"' and cannot work in the IDE, how can I fix this?

This means one of two things:

1. Your account was not created on the IDE server

or

2. You changed your GitHub username between when your account was created on the IDE server and when you tried to connect.

Then ask for help from the Commit.live at tech@greyatom.com

# Can I use Commit.Live IDE across more than one computer? 

Yes, the Commit.Live IDE can be used across multiple computers.

Instructions to get an already started or already completed lab from one computer to another with the Commit.Live IDE:

1. From the computer that has your latest work, make sure your code has been pushed up to GitHub by using `clive Submit`

The Commit.Live IDE will now have an updated copy of your work, and will automatically remain synced to new computer. If you want to switch back to a different computer, you'll need to follow the above steps again.
